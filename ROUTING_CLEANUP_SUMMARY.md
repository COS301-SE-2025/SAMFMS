# SAMFMS Routing System Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Old Core Routes

**Files Removed:**

- `Core/routes/maintenance.py` - Old maintenance routes proxy
- `Core/routes/consolidated.py` - Old consolidated routing system
- `Core/routes/api/maintenance.py` - Old maintenance API routes
- `Core/routes/api/assignments.py` - Old assignments API routes
- `Core/routes/api/trips.py` - Old trips API routes
- `Core/routes/api/gps.py` - Old GPS API routes

**Files Updated:**

- `Core/routes/api/__init__.py` - Removed deleted route imports
- `Core/main.py` - Removed fallback to old maintenance routes

### 2. Updated Management Service Block

**Files Removed:**

- `Sblocks/management/api/routes/assignments.py` - Assignments route removed

**Files Updated:**

- `Sblocks/management/main.py` - Removed assignments router import and inclusion
- Service registration tags updated to reflect only vehicles, drivers, analytics

### 3. Core Service Routing

The Core service now uses simplified path-based routing:

- `/management/*` → Management service block (vehicles, drivers, analytics only)
- `/maintenance/*` → Maintenance service block
- `/gps/*` → GPS service block
- `/trips/*` → Trip planning service block

### 4. Management Service Routes

The Management service now only provides these main routes:

- `/api/v1/vehicles` - Vehicle management
- `/api/v1/drivers` - Driver management
- `/api/v1/analytics` - Analytics and reporting

**Removed Routes:**

- `/api/v1/assignments` - Assignments functionality removed

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Simplified Routing**: Clear path-based routing eliminates complex route mappings
2. **Service Isolation**: Each service block handles its own domain
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer route files and imports to manage
4. **Better Separation**: Management service focused on core entities only
5. **RabbitMQ Communication**: All inter-service communication via message queues

## How It Works

### Request Flow

1. Client sends request to Core service (e.g., `GET /management/vehicles`)
2. Core service strips prefix and forwards via RabbitMQ (`GET /vehicles` → Management service)
3. Management service processes request and responds via RabbitMQ
4. Core service returns response to client

### Service Blocks

- **Management**: Handles vehicles, drivers, analytics
- **Maintenance**: Handles maintenance schedules, work orders, licenses
- **GPS**: Handles location tracking, geofencing
- **Trip Planning**: Handles route planning, trip optimization

## Testing

Use the test script to verify the cleanup:

```bash
python test_cleaned_routing.py
```

This will test both the Core service routing and the Management service endpoints.

## Next Steps

1. Start Core service and Management service
2. Test the routing system
3. Verify RabbitMQ communication
4. Update other service blocks to use the new routing pattern
5. Update frontend to use the new API structure
