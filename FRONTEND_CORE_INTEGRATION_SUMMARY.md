# Frontend-Core Integration Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Import Errors in Maintenance Service Routes

**Problem**: The maintenance service routes had incorrect import paths and function names.
**Files Fixed**:

- `Sblocks/maintenance/api/routes/maintenance_records.py`
- `Sblocks/maintenance/api/routes/licenses.py`
- `Sblocks/maintenance/api/routes/analytics.py`
- `Sblocks/maintenance/api/routes/notifications.py`

**Changes Made**:

- Fixed import paths from `dependencies` to `api.dependencies`
- Changed `get_authenticated_user` to `get_current_user`
- Changed `require_permissions` to `require_permission`
- Changed `get_request_timer` to `RequestTimer` context manager
- Updated all route handlers to use proper async patterns

### 2. Frontend API Configuration Mismatch

**Problem**: Frontend was calling `/api/*` endpoints but backend was using direct service routing.
**Files Fixed**:

- `Frontend/samfms/src/config/apiConfig.js`

**Changes Made**:

- Updated all API endpoints to match backend routing structure:
  - `/api/vehicles` → `/vehicles`
  - `/api/maintenance/*` → `/maintenance/*`
  - `/api/management/*` → `/management/*`
  - `/api/gps/*` → `/gps/*`
  - `/api/trips/*` → `/trips/*`

### 3. Core Service Integration

**Problem**: Core service was missing direct vehicle routes for frontend compatibility.
**Files Fixed**:

- `Core/main.py`

**Changes Made**:

- Added import for `routes.api.api_router` to provide direct vehicle routes
- Maintained service routing for maintenance, management, GPS, and trips
- Added proper error handling and logging

## Current Architecture

### Frontend → Core Integration

1. **Direct Routes**: Vehicle management calls go directly to Core's vehicle routes
2. **Service Routing**: All other calls (maintenance, management, GPS, trips) go through Core's service routing to respective service blocks via RabbitMQ

### Frontend API Endpoints

```javascript
// Direct routes (handled by Core)
/vehicles/*
/vehicles/drivers/*

// Service-routed endpoints (handled by service blocks)
/maintenance/*
/management/*
/gps/*
/trips/*
```

### Core Service Routing

```python
# Direct routes (in Core)
@app.include_router(api_router)  # Handles /vehicles/*

# Service routing (to service blocks)
@app.include_router(service_router)  # Handles /maintenance/*, /management/*, etc.
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Frontend API Calls**: Test all API endpoints to ensure they reach the correct services
2. **Service Block Integration**: Verify that maintenance, management, GPS, and trips services receive requests properly
3. **Error Handling**: Test error scenarios to ensure proper error messages are returned
4. **Authentication**: Verify that authentication flows work correctly across all routes

## Next Steps

1. Test the integration by running the Core service and frontend
2. Verify that maintenance service routes work properly
3. Test other service blocks (management, GPS, trips) for similar integration issues
4. Update any remaining API configuration mismatches if found
